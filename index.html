<p>There were about six hundred Academies in Italy in this period. Academies raise interesting questions about early modern Europe. For example, what was the relationship between the Academies and the Universities? Did women have a role within Academies, and if so what? What was the role of printers? How many foreigners took part in the life and publications of Italian Academies? Alongside their serious debates, Academies had a more playful aspect, which is reflected in the names and devices of the Academies and their members.</p>

<p>With the Neoplatonist revival that accompanied the revival of humanist studies, accademia took on newly vivid connotations.</p>

<p>During the Florentine Renaissance, Cosimo de' Medici took a personal interest in the new Platonic Academy that he determined to re-establish in 1439, centered on the marvellous promise shown by the young Marsilio Ficino. Cosimo had been inspired by the arrival at the otherwise ineffective Council of Florence of Gemistos Plethon, who seemed a dazzling figure to the Florentine intellectuals. In 1462 Cosimo gave Ficino a villa at Careggi for the Academy's use, situated where Cosimo could see it from his own villa, and drop by for visits. The academy remained a wholly informal group, but one which had a great influence on Renaissance Neo-Platonism.</p>

<a name="subjects" class="anchor" href="#subjects"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Subjects</h2>

<p>The interests of the Academies covered literature, culture and the sciences and ranged over many subjects: from astronomy to theatre, from poetry to politics, from linguistics to music, and the figurative arts. Academies published in all these and many other fields. </p>

<h2>
<a name="membership" class="anchor" href="#membership"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Membership</h2>

<p>Membership included pioneering scientists, literary polemicists, political thinkers, and representatives of all social classes. Members of Academies adopted curious and amusing nicknames and pseudonyms. </p>
